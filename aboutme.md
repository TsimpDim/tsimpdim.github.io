Heyo, it's me, Tsimpitas Dimitris, frequently known as TsDim or TsimpDim :D  

I'm mostly a backend developer focusing on cloud hyperscalers - mainly AWS. As soon as I, through my internship, got in touch with the world of cloud computing suffice to say that I was hooked. All the cloud platforms seem to offer tons of little miracles (so-called "services") which allow one to fullfil each and every use case that might trouble them - and I find that fantastic.  

Coding, however, isn't just my profession, it's also my hobby. I always find it very satisfying to see personal ideas come to fruition and as such you can image that many of my side projects try to solve an issue of mine (just like this blog which you're currently on), and if they can be of use to other people even better!

Aside from my coding profession/hobby, I'm also an avid landscape photographer. I initially started photography using my dad's antiquated Olympus SP550UZ but after a lot of frustration with it I equipped myself with my trusty Canon M100 mirorless camera I try to fully explore the city I live in (or travel to) and capture what my experience of it - be that good or bad - is through the lens. Photography is a hobby which I have connected with cycling! Me, my camera, and my MTB/Hybrid have travelled a whole lot, and I wholeheartedly recommend this combination.  

In the past I also used to dabble in a bit of 3D art using Blender 3D (before 3.x) in the hope of sharpening my creativity skills, but alas this hobby has been taken over by photography.
